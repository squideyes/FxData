**SquidEyes.FxData** is an collection of high-performance C#/.NET 6.0 trading-data primatives with a set of full-coverage unit-tests.  This code is a hard-fork of the author's <a href="https://github.com/squideyes/Trading" target="_blank">SquidEyes.Trading</a> library, with the data-oriented classes (i.e. TickSet) tweaked to support day-trading scenarios.  The quote unquote trading code (i.e. indicators, order management objects, etc.) has been removed.

Be forewarned, though, that literally no effort has been made to make the various classes and methods suitable for a general audience.
